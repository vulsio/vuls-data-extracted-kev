				"description": "Juniper Junos OS on EX Series contains a missing authentication for critical function vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the file system integrity. With a specific request to installAppPackage.php that doesn't require authentication, an attacker is able to upload arbitrary files via J-Web, leading to a loss of integrity for a certain part of the file system, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities.",
